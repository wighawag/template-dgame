A comprehensive template for building decentralized games that use commit+reveal mechanics. This project demonstrates a fully functional on-chain game using zer0 backend, providing a foundation for building trustless, verifiable multiplayer games.

## 🎮 What is this?

**Reveal or Die** is both a working demo and a development template. It showcases how to build decentralized games using commit+reveal mechanics to prevent front-running and ensure fair gameplay. The game features:

- **Avatar-based gameplay** where players control digital avatars
- **Multi-zone world** exploration and interaction
- **Time-based epochs** with commit and reveal phases
- **Trustless state management** via smart contracts
- **Real-time web interface** built with Svelte and Pixi.js

## 🏗️ Architecture

This monorepo contains two main components:

### 🌐 Web Application (`/web`)

- **Framework**: Svelte + SvelteKit
- **Graphics**: Pixi.js for high-performance 2D rendering
- **Blockchain**: Viem for Ethereum interactions
- **UI**: TailwindCSS with custom game controls
- **Features**: Real-time game visualization, wallet integration, tutorial system

### ⛓️ Smart Contracts (`/onchain/evm`)

- **Framework**: Hardhat v3 with TypeScript
- **Language**: Solidity ^0.8.0
- **Features**:
  - Commit-reveal game mechanics
  - Avatar system
  - Zone-based world system
  - Epoch-based time management
  - Multi-network deployment support

### 🛡️ No Server Required

The game runs entirely in the browser without requiring any centralized servers or indexers. All game state is stored and verified directly on the blockchain, ensuring:

- **True Decentralization**: No single point of failure
- **Trustless Gameplay**: All moves are cryptographically verifiable
- **Direct Blockchain Interaction**: Players interact directly with smart contracts
- **No Backend Dependencies**: The game works as long as blockchain networks are operational

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Reveal or Die** is designed with two core principles in mind:

- **No Server**: Everything operates on-chain. No centralized servers, no API dependencies, no indexers required. The game runs entirely in the browser and communicates directly with blockchain networks.

- **Not a Framework or Engine, but a Template**: This is not a rigid framework that constrains your design or forces you into specific patterns. Instead, it's a template where you modify what you want and keep what you want. Start with a working, complete game and customize every aspect - the game mechanics, visual style, user interface, blockchain interactions, or any other component to match your vision.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v10 or higher)
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Zellij** (recommended for development workflow)

### Installation

You can use this repository in two ways:

#### Option 1: Use as GitHub Template

1. Click the **"Use this template"** button on the GitHub repository page
2. Give your new repository a name and description
3. Clone your new repository:

```bash
git clone <your-new-repository-url>
cd <your-project-name>
pnpm install
```

#### Option 2: Clone Directly

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd reveal-or-die
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start full development environment (requires Zellij)
pnpm start

# Or start components individually
pnpm web:dev          # Start web application
pnpm onchain:dev      # Start smart contract development
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
pnpm build

# Build specific components
pnpm web:build        # Build web application
pnpm onchain:build    # Compile and export contracts
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Commit-Reveal Cycle

The game operates in epochs with two distinct phases:

1. **Commit Phase**: Players submit hashed moves (commitments)
2. **Reveal Phase**: Players reveal their actual moves and secrets

This mechanism ensures:

- **Fairness**: No player can see others' moves before committing
- **Integrity**: All moves are verifiable on-chain
- **Security**: Prevents front-running and manipulation

### Core Game Loop

1. **Purchase Avatar**: Buy or mint your game avatar
2. **Join Game**: Connect your wallet and enter the game world
3. **Commit Move**: During commit phase, submit your intended action
4. **Reveal Move**: During reveal phase, execute your committed action
5. **Progress**: Watch your avatar move and interact in real-time

### World System

- **Zones**: The game world is divided into zones for organization
- **Avatars**: Player-owned characters that can move and interact
- **Epochs**: Time-based rounds that govern game progression

## 📖 Contract Documentation

The smart contracts are well-documented and follow modern Solidity patterns:

- **`IGame`**: Main game interface defining core functionality
- **`UsingGameInternal`**: Internal game logic and state management
- **`GameCommit`**: Commit phase implementation
- **`GameReveal`**: Reveal phase implementation
- **`Avatars`**: NFT-based avatar system

## 🎨 Customization

This template is designed to be easily customized:

1. **Game Logic**: Modify contract functions in `/onchain/evm/src/game/`
2. **Graphics**: Update rendering components in `/web/src/lib/render/`
3. **UI/UX**: Customize components in `/web/src/lib/ui/`
4. **World Design**: Define zones and areas in contract data

## 🤝 Contributing

This template serves as a foundation for building various types of decentralized games. When extending or modifying:

1. Maintain the commit-reveal pattern for critical game mechanics
2. Keep all game state on-chain for verifiability
3. Ensure the web interface remains responsive and intuitive
4. Test thoroughly across different network configurations
