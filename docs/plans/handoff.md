# Handoff: where reveal-or-die is, and how to work on it

Written at `37bcceb` and updated at `c0d232f`, on `port/template-commit-reveal`.
Read this before `web-port.md`, which is the detailed record; this is the
orientation.

## State

The web port is done. The game is playable end to end: sign in, buy an avatar,
spawn, move, leave, and the round commits and reveals by itself.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| branch | `port/template-commit-reveal`. **Never work on `main`**, which is the pre-port app and 50+ commits behind |
| `cd web && pnpm check` | 0 errors |
| `cd web && pnpm test:unit` | 1445 + 53, all passing, about 40 seconds |
| `cd contracts && pnpm test` | 9 passing |
| `cd web && pnpm build localhost` | clean |

Run `pnpm test:unit`, NOT a bare `vitest`: it runs the two projects one after
the other, and running them together makes the suite take minutes and fail. See
the note in `web/vite.config.ts`, which measured it.

## The single most important thing to understand

This repo is a DESCENDANT of `template-commit-reveal`, which descends from
`jolly-roger`. The `stem` remote points at the template.

**`web/src/lib/core/` and `web/src/lib/game/` are not ours.** They are
byte-identical to upstream, 129 and 19 files, and keeping them that way is what
makes merging free. Before changing anything under those paths, check whether it
is identical to `stem/main`; if it is, the change almost certainly belongs
upstream instead.

What IS ours: `lib/world/` (this game), `lib/context/game.ts` below its stated
line, `lib/world/ui/`, `contracts/`, and `routes/play`.

`lib/input/` used to be on that list, marked as the odd one: generic keyboard
and gamepad intent recognisers, held outside `lib/game/` because that tree is
byte-identical to the template, and labelled a BACKPORT CANDIDATE by its own
README. **It is gone, and how it went is the part worth keeping.** It was
backported by being WRITTEN AGAIN upstream (`game/render/{keys,gamepad,
intents}.ts`) while this repo carried on importing its own copy, so for five
days both trees held the same recognisers and the same tests, differing only in
their comments, with nothing anywhere to notice. `lib/world/controls.ts` now
imports the inherited modules and the copy is deleted.

The rule that produced the mistake was right and is unchanged: something that
belongs upstream goes upstream and arrives here by merge, never written into the
merged tree by hand. What it needed was its other half. **A backport is a MOVE:
the descendant's copy is deleted in the same change that lands the upstream
one**, because until it is, a re-implementation and a move look exactly alike.

### Merging from upstream

    git fetch stem
    git merge-tree --write-tree HEAD stem/main    # exit 0 means clean
    git merge --no-ff stem/main

Conflicts are almost always in `web/src/lib/placement/**` (the template's own
demo game, which this repo deleted and replaced with `lib/world/`). The
resolution is to keep them deleted, but **read the diff first**. At `37bcceb` one
of those conflicts carried a real behavioural fix to
`placement/commit-reveal.ts`, the file `lib/world/commit-reveal.ts` was written
from, and deleting our copy of theirs would have discarded it silently. A
modify/delete conflict on a `placement/` file is the only signal that the
template improved something we inherited.

The fanout tool does not reach this repo: it targets `reveal-or-die@main` while
the work is here, so it has been removed from the registry
(`~/.offshoot-stems/template-svelte.json`, `ignore: ["reveal-or-die"]`). Merges
are by hand until that is sorted.

## How the last stretch of work has gone, and the lesson in it

Roughly a dozen defects were found by actually playing the game. The pattern,
which held five or six times:

**Before writing anything in `lib/world/`, check whether the shared layer
already has it.** Payer selection, gas reserves, stale-wallet-balance handling,
a payer chooser, a consent step before a signature: every one of those was
written here first and already existed in `core/funding` or
`ui/credits/top-up-flow.ts`, better, with the reasoning recorded. Each time the
private copy was deleted afterwards. `web/src/lib/ui/credits/README.md` and
`web/src/lib/core/funding/README.md` are the two files worth reading before
building anything that touches money.

**Defects in shared code go upstream, not here.** Five have now been fixed in
`jolly-roger` (or `@etherplay/connect`) and merged back: the "Wallet Action
Required" modal firing on silent signer sends, the funds modal assuming only two
possible payers, the top-up modal opening beneath the modal that raised it, a
delegation signature that no dialog announced, and the test suite's worker
contention. Writing a prompt and waiting is slower per fix and much cheaper
overall, because every sibling gets it and this repo keeps a clean merge.

When writing such a prompt: say which BRANCH it lands on, and check rather than
guess. `jolly-roger@main` has no local signer and composes no payment rail, so
anything touching either belongs on `with/local-signer`. Say "do not touch
reveal-or-die" explicitly, since the fanout skips it.

**Test that the test bites.** Delete the fix, watch the test fail, put it back.
Three tests written during this stretch passed with the code they covered
removed, including one asserting `not.toThrow()` for a defect whose entire
nature was that it did not throw.

## What is left

In the order I would take it. `web-port.md` has the detail.

1. **The red "you cannot move" border**, which wants restyling to match shadcn.
2. **The home page**, which still shows the template's copy rather than this
   game's.

Done since this was first written, all recorded in `web-port.md`: the controls
(keyboard, gamepad and an on-screen d-pad), the Exit action, the exit tile being
the only way out (contract and client), and a purchase surviving a reload.

## Things that are known and deliberately not fixed

- **The map is one 16x16 area tiled infinitely.** `areaAt` carries a
  `TODO add in genesis hash ?` and returns `Areas[0]` for every zone. The
  renderer is faithful; the data is a placeholder.
- **The round number is an absolute epoch index** (about 44,700,000), because
  `startTime` is 0 and epochs are counted from the unix epoch.
- **MetaMask can refuse a transaction after a faucet claim**, showing a stale
  balance while the app correctly reads the new one. Diagnosed as MetaMask's own
  UI cache rather than anything readable through its provider, so there is
  nothing to fix here; it is faucet-only and a real deployment would not hit it.
- **A deployed game needs a REDEPLOY after the `numMissesAllowed` change.** The Game `Config` struct gained a field, so every route's constructor args changed. Until a deployment carries it, `linkedData.numMissesAllowed` is absent and the death notice explains the death without quoting a number, which is deliberate.

- **`Avatars.mint` has no access control**, and `_enter` accepts an obstacle as
  an entry position. Both are recorded in the contracts and in
  `docs/plans/identity-without-consent.md`.
- **A refused Exit is DROPPED, not reverted**, exactly as a refused move is.
  `_exit` sets `stopProcessing` and the avatar stays where it is. Reverting the
  reveal instead would cost the player every action in the turn and block the
  next epoch until `acknowledgeMissedReveal`, which is far worse than the
  mistake; `UnableToExitFromThisPosition` therefore stays declared and unthrown,
  beside the other rules `UsingGameErrors.sol` states and enforces elsewhere.

## Verification, and what nobody has checked

Nothing in this repo has an automated end-to-end test against a chain, so the
things below have only ever been confirmed by hand, and two have not been
confirmed at all:

- the faucet aimed at a payment-rail wallet
- the delegation modal now that `@etherplay/connect` 0.11.2 announces the request
- **every part of the controls and the Exit action.** The recognisers, the
  intent-to-action mapping and the key guards are covered by unit tests that
  were each checked by breaking the code under them, but nothing has driven a
  real keyboard or a real gamepad at a real board, and no exit has ever been
  revealed on chain. The pixi ring drawn for a planned exit is not covered by
  anything.
- **purchase recovery across a reload.** Every rule in it is unit tested,
  including the guard, which was checked by restoring the original bug and
  watching the double purchase go through. What is unverified is its premise:
  that a rail-paid purchase actually reaches account data on a real chain. That
  is the upstream fix, merged and never run here against a node.

Local setup: port 8545 belongs to something else, so start a node elsewhere and
point `contracts/.env.local` at it. `web/src/lib/deployments.ts` is generated and
gitignored; `pnpm install` regenerates it from the committed deployment records,
so a fresh clone typechecks before it has deployed anything.

**The dev node must mine on a SHORT interval, and `hardhat.config.ts` sets one
second for `local`.** This is not a preference. Epochs are defined against
`block.timestamp`, while the client's clock interpolates from the wall clock
between blocks, so the client crosses a round boundary the moment real time
says so and the chain only crosses when a block carries a later timestamp.
Every second of block interval is a second of that gap, and it shows up in play
as the board sitting in `catching-up` at every boundary and as another player's
move appearing seconds into the next window. It was three seconds; both symptoms
were reported from play before the cause was found. A node that mines only on
transactions is far worse: the gap then lasts until somebody's next
transaction, which is how a catch-up took fifteen seconds.
