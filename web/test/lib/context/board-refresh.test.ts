/**
 * The two places the board refreshes itself beyond the poller's own interval,
 * and the reasoning each one exists for:
 *
 * - during the reveal window, because another player's move is invisible from
 *   here and a 5s poll turns the one moment the game is about into a wait;
 * - when a round starts, because the client's clock crosses the epoch boundary
 *   AHEAD of the chain, and the poller's own answer to that ("not yet", then
 *   backoff) leaves the new round playing on last epoch's board.
 *
 * Both are wiring that acts unprompted, so both are functions of two stores
 * and a callback, testable with fake timers and no app context.
 */

/**
 * FRESH STORES PER TEST, and the leak that made it necessary is worth naming:
 * with one set shared across the file, a watcher a test forgot to stop stayed
 * subscribed, and the next test's `phase.set` woke it - scheduling timers the
 * next test then counted as its own. Shared mutable fixtures in a file about
 * timers are a way to debug the fixture instead of the code.
