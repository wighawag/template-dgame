/**
 * What is left of this file after `refreshDuringReveal` and
 * `settleBoardWhenRoundStarts` went back to being the framework's.
 *
 * Both were COPIED into `context/game.ts` at some point and were being
 * maintained here as well as in `game/core/refresh.ts`, identical in every
 * executable line and differing only in doc comments - the same failure the
 * input recognisers had, undetected because nothing in this tree diffs a
 * descendant against its stem. Their eleven tests are inherited now, at
 * `test/lib/game/core/refresh.test.ts`, and run unchanged.
 *
 * What stays is this game's own. `canTakeTurnNow` is the clearest case of
 * where the seam falls: it is `setup === undefined && phase === 'play'`, and
 * the first half is THIS game's rule about what a player must hold before
 * acting while only the second is the framework's.

 * next test then counted as its own. Shared mutable fixtures in a file about
 * timers are a way to debug the fixture instead of the code.
