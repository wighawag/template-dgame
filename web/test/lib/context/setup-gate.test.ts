/**
 * The gate in front of a player's first move.
 *
 * Two opposite failures, both invisible from reading it. Too LOOSE and the
 * board invites a turn that cannot be committed: `makeCommitment` resolves the
 * sender against the account's registered delegates and reverts with
 * `NotDelegate`, so an unauthorised browser lets someone plan a whole round and
 * then fails as the phase closes, which is when it is too late to fix. Too
 * STRICT and it hides a perfectly playable board behind a demand the player has
 * already met - and since the delegation answer arrives from a chain read, the
 * obvious way to get that wrong is to treat "not read yet" as "not allowed".
 *
 * The answer is a FIELD now, not an address comparison. The read is scoped to
 * the (account, this browser's signer) pair, so it says whether THIS browser
 * may play; an account may authorise several, and no single address the chain
 * could return would have been an answer about this one.
