/**
 * The handover between the two things that draw a turn.
 *
 * Before it resolves, the player's turn is drawn from LOCAL INTENT: planned
 * dots, an exit ring, and for an avatar that is not in the world yet, the
 * entering preview `mergeWorldView` invents. After it resolves, the same turn
 * is drawn from the BOARD, which holds it back until the round is over so that
 * a simultaneous round is not shown in the order the reveals were paid for.
 *
 * The round drops its actions the instant it reaches `Revealed`, seconds
 * before the board releases what they did, so the two used to change hands at
 * different moments and the player was shown NEITHER in between: the path
 * vanished while the avatar stood still, and a planned entry made the avatar
 * disappear from the board entirely for the rest of the reveal window.
