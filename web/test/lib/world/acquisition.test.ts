/**
 * Six positional arguments, two of which are addresses that mean opposite
 * things.
 *
 * `AvatarsSale.purchase(to, subID, data, tipTo, tipAmount, referrer)` takes the
 * recipient of the NFT as `to` and the OWNER encoded inside `data`. Here `to` is
 * the Game, so the avatar arrives already deposited, and the owner is the
 * player. Swapping them does not revert: it mints a perfectly good avatar into
 * the player's wallet, where `avatarsPerOwner` never sees it and every commit
 * fails. That failure is why this list is a pure function with a test rather
 * than an inline array.
 *
 * Everything ABOVE these arguments - who pays, the consent step, the stipend
 * pairing, the recovery of a purchase that outlived its tab - is the shared
 * acquisition rail and is tested at `test/lib/game/acquire/`.
