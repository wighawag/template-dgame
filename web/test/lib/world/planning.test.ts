/**

 * area and pinned against the chain by
 * `contracts/test/js/Game.test.ts > agrees with the contract about what can be
 * stood on`:
 *
 * The neighbourhood, `#` unwalkable, columns x=-2..3:
 *
 *   y=0   .###.#
 *   y=1   .....#
 *   y=2   .#.#.#
 *   y=3   ......
 *   y=4   ######
 *
 * So (0,0) is an obstacle, (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) form a corridor north to south,
 * and it turns east at y=3 because y=4 is solid.
 *
 * The area's ONE exit tile is at (3,5). Its neighbourhood, columns x=2..5:
 *
 *   y=4   x#.#
 *   y=5   x!..
 *   y=6   x#.#
 *
 * so it is walled north and south, boxed to the west, and reached from the
