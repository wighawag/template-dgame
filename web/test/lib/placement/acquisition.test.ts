/**
 * Three arguments, two of which are addresses that mean opposite things.
 *
 * `StakeSale.purchase(player, stipendTo, stipend)` credits the reserve to
 * `player` and forwards gas to `stipendTo`. Swapping them does not revert: it
 * stakes for the local signing key, which is exactly the address that must
 * never own anything (it lives in one browser's storage, and clearing site data
 * would take the stake with it). That failure is why this list is a pure
 * function with a test rather than an inline array.
