/**
 * NO SHARED MODULE NAMES THE CONCRETE IDENTITY TYPE.
 *
 * Rule N3 of Decision 3 in the plan on the `work` branch, enforced rather than
 * asserted. `with/nft-identity` is a branch of this repo where the reference
 * game's identity stops being an address and becomes a token id. Every shared
 * file that spells the identity out concretely is a file that branch has to
 * edit, and an edited shared file is a conflict site for as long as both sides
 * keep developing. The whole arrangement is worth exactly as much as the
 * number of such files, which is why this is a test and not a paragraph.
 *
 * THE RULE HAD TO BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY, and the obvious one is false. Banning
 * `0x${string}` from shared modules would fail on secrets, commitment hashes,
 * contract addresses, the payer, the owner and every signature - all of which
 * are addresses or hex in every configuration and must stay that way. A check
 * that fires on correct code is one somebody deletes, so this does not look at
 * the type at all.
 *
 * It looks at the FRAMEWORK'S IDENTITY-PARAMETERISED GENERICS instead. Those
 * are the sites where a type argument means "this is what a player IS", and
 * they are unambiguous: there is no other reason to pass a type to
 * `createRound`. Wherever application code instantiates one of them, the
 * identity argument has to be the alias.
 *
 * THE MIRROR-IMAGE RULE MATTERS JUST AS MUCH, and it is the second block
 * below: `game/core/` must NOT name the alias. The framework stays generic
 * over `TIdentity extends PlayerIdentity`, because that genericity is the
 * thing that makes a one-line difference possible at all. A well-meaning
 * simplification that hard-coded `GameIdentity` into the framework would leave
 * every assertion in the first block passing while destroying what they
 * protect.
 *
 * WRITTEN TO SURVIVE THE CASCADE. This file is inherited by every game built
 * on this template, where the layout is different: reveal-or-die has no
 * `lib/placement/` at all, and its alias is `bigint`. So nothing here asserts
 * that a particular file exists or that the alias has a particular value. It
 * enumerates what the repo actually has and judges that. The one previous
 * version of a check in this tree that encoded a fact about THIS repo's layout
 * passed here and failed on the first merge down, for a reason that had
 * nothing to do with the rule it was enforcing.

/**

 * so a concrete type there is a TEST FIXTURE picking one instance of the type
 * parameter, not an application declaring what its players are. They pin the
 * ADDRESS case specifically, which is valuable exactly where it looks
 * redundant: in a descendant whose own identity is a `bigint`, the inherited
 * copies of these suites are the only coverage the address half of
 * `PlayerIdentity` has. Forcing them onto the alias would delete that, and
 * would break the descendant on the first cascade, since its alias is a
 * `bigint` and its fixtures are addresses.
