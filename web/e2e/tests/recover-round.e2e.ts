/**
 * A turn the chain holds and this browser has lost - worked out, not asked for.
 *
 * The situation is the ordinary one rather than an exotic mode: a cleared
 * browser, a second device, a private window, a reinstall and a storage write
 * that silently failed all produce the identical state. The contract holds a
 * commitment, a reveal is owed this epoch, and the client knows nothing about
 * it. Unhandled, the turn is lost and three of those in a row kill the avatar.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GAME DOES THAT THE TEMPLATE'S CANNOT. A turn here is a walk of at
 * most `numMoves` steps over walkable cells, and the maze keeps that small
 * enough to SEARCH: the app recomputes the secret, enumerates the walks and
 * hashes them until one matches what the chain is holding. So the player is
 * asked nothing and presses nothing, which is the assertion below - the round
 * comes back on its own. The template's game has to ask, because a turn there
 * is any subset of the cells on an open board.
 *
 * SHORTEST FIRST is why this is fast rather than merely possible. A turn of one
 * step is found within a handful of candidates; the thousands only get
 * enumerated when the answer is not there at all.
 *
 * IT ALL HAS TO HAPPEN INSIDE ONE EPOCH, which shapes the test: a commitment is
 * recoverable only while the epoch it belongs to is running, and one tick later
 * it is a missed reveal, which is a different suite's subject.
