/**
 * A round this browser has lost, which the chain still holds.
 *
 * NOT a storage feature, and the suite is arranged to say so. A cleared
 * browser, a second device, a second browser, a private window, a reinstall
 * and a storage write that silently failed all produce the identical state:
 * the contract holds a commitment, a reveal is owed this epoch, and this
 * client knows nothing about it. Unhandled, that costs the stake in silence.
 *
 * It is the sibling of the missed-reveal suite above, and the two are the same
 * subject at different points on the clock. There the reveal window has shut,
 * so the bond is gone and all that is left is to settle it; here the window is
 * still OPEN, so the whole difference is that somebody asked the chain in time.
 *
 * THE ROUND IS DESTROYED THE SAME WAY the missed-reveal test destroys it, and
 * for the same reason: the round's own record is deleted and the page
 * reloaded, rather than a fresh browser context being opened. The burner wallet
 * generates its accounts per browser and signing in derives the signer from
 * those, so a clean context is a DIFFERENT PLAYER altogether and would prove
 * nothing about recovery.
 *
 * IT ALL HAS TO HAPPEN INSIDE ONE EPOCH, which is what shapes the test. A
 * commitment is only recoverable while the epoch it belongs to is running - one
 * tick later it is a missed reveal, which is the suite above - so the re-entry
 * cannot use `planOnCanvas`, whose wait for the next play phase would be a wait
 * for the epoch that makes recovery impossible.
 *
 * WHAT THE HAPPY PATH PROVES that no unit test can: that the hash this app
 * builds a candidate plan into is the hash the CONTRACT stored. If the two
 * disagreed, the adopted round would reveal and the reveal would revert, and
 * the last assertion here would never be reached. The refusal of a WRONG plan
 * is pinned by unit tests instead, and by mutation, because it needs no chain.
