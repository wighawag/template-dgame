 * the app must never call it on the player's behalf - it has to say what
 * happened, what it cost, and wait to be asked.
 *
 * The reveal is missed here the way it is missed in real life: the tab goes
 * away before the reveal phase. The second half then uses a BRAND-NEW browser
 * context, so nothing is left in local storage and the only way the app can
