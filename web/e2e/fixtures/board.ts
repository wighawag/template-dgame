 * Reading and driving THIS game's board, for the suites that play a round.

 * A DELIBERATELY NEW PATH, not `fixtures/game.ts`. That file is the parent
 * template's game fixture and is listed in `.offshoot-omissions`: it reads a
 * per-cell `totalStake` off a board of cells, which this game does not have.
 * Writing this one beside it under a different name means the template can go
 * on changing its own fixture without ever conflicting with this, and the
 * omission stays a one-line lookup instead of a merge to re-decide.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GAME IS, since every assertion below depends on it. A player owns
 * an AVATAR, held in the game contract's custody - that custody is the bond,
 * and there is no token reserve and no per-cell stake. An avatar is either out
 * of the world or standing at a position. A turn is planned as a sequence of
 * actions (enter, move, exit), committed as a hash, and revealed in the next
 * phase; only the reveal puts anything on the board, which is the property the
 * commit-reveal round exists to have.
 *
 * Everything here reads the app's own stores rather than pixels. The board is a
 * canvas, so there is nothing to query in the DOM, and an assertion about what
 * the game BELIEVES fails with a value rather than with "element not found".
