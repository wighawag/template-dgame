	 * server would be paying to evaluate a renderer it can never use. It also
	 * keeps the rendering library out of the bundle for every route that is not
	 * the game.
	 *
	 * This used to be load-bearing for a sharper reason: `pixi-viewport` shipped
	 * no `exports` field, so SSR resolved its UMD build and the page 500d in dev
	 * with "Named export 'Viewport' not found". That dependency is gone, so the
	 * failure is gone with it, but the two reasons above are not, and a renderer
	 * is exactly the kind of dependency that acquires such a problem again.
	 * Worth knowing if it ever recurs: `pnpm build` does NOT catch it, because
	 * prerendering resolves dependencies differently and succeeds. It shows up
	 * only in `pnpm web:dev`.
	 *
	 * WHICH canvas is not decided here: `$lib/world/render` names it, next to
	 * the renderer that has to match it. Both hosts take the same props, so this
	 * page is identical whichever is chosen.

	 * A decision, not a detail, and the two alternatives are each wrong in a way
	 * somebody would have to debug:
	 *
	 * - THE CANVAS'S lifetime is shorter than the game's. It mounts late (the
	 *   dynamic import above) and not at all when the chunk fails, so binding
	 *   input to it means keys that do nothing for the first moments of every
	 *   visit and a board that is silently uncontrollable whenever the `:catch`
	 *   branch is up. That coupling is what `work:docs/audits/03-renderer.md` 4.2 says
	 *   to undo, and the previous build had it: input was owned by the renderer,
	 *   and its teardown called `removeAllListeners()` on an emitter the canvas
	 *   was using too.
	 *
	 * - THE APP'S lifetime is longer. `context.start()` runs from the layout for
	 *   the whole session (`context/Context.svelte`), so binding there would leave
	 *   the arrow keys planning moves while the player is reading the account
	 *   panel on another route - invisibly, since the board is not on screen to
	 *   show it.
	 *
	 * The route is exactly the span where a key press means a move, which is why
	 * the binding lives in this file and the MAPPING does not: `game.controls`
	 * is built in the context, so the d-pad and this share one set of rules.

<!--
	The game fills the space the app shell leaves, rather than the whole viewport:
	it is a route inside the template, not a replacement for it.

	`h-full`, and that is the whole calculation now. The shell (ADR-0007,
	`core/ui/AppShell.svelte`) renders every page into a region that is EXACTLY the
	viewport minus whatever chrome is up, so `100%` here means the screen minus the
	navbar minus however many condition bars are live, without this file knowing
	which bars exist or how tall they are.

	IT USED TO SAY `h-[calc(100dvh-3rem)]`, with a comment that `3rem` was the
	navbar's own `h-12` and there was no variable to track. Both halves were the
	bug. The number was a fourth spelling of the navbar's height, and subtracting
	the navbar ALONE is right for zero bars and wrong for every other case: with
	offline, no-RPC, a stale nonce cache or a dispatch in flight, this box was one
	bar taller than the space it had, the document grew a scrollbar this
	`overflow-hidden` could not absorb, and `GameHud` below is `absolute inset-0
	... justify-between`, so its BOTTOM row went under the fold. The casualty was
	the phase clock, which is the thing a player needs to see, and nothing looked
	broken until a condition fired.

	It stays in NORMAL FLOW. `absolute inset-0` looks like the obvious way to fill
	the page and is wrong here: with no positioned ancestor it pins to the
	viewport, so the canvas slides up underneath the `z-50` navbar, which then
	covers the top of the HUD. Same casualty, reached from the other direction.
