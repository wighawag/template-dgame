/**
 * Send a game move and wait for it to be included.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT go through `balanceCheck.ensureCanAfford`.
 *
 * That helper is the app's user-facing spending check: it opens a modal for the
 * whole call ("Preparing Transaction" while it estimates, then an
 * insufficient-funds prompt), and it checks the balance of the WALLET. Neither
 * is right for a move. A move is signed by the local signer with no prompt, so
 * a modal appearing over the board on every commit and every reveal is exactly
 * the interruption the signer exists to remove - and the balance it was
 * checking belonged to a different address from the one actually paying.
 *
 * The signer needs gas of its own; that is surfaced up front as a balance the
 * player can top up, not discovered mid-round. See `signerBalance` in the
 * context.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES DO, since 'after the fact' turned out not to be free: it refuses
 * to put a move on the wire when the app ALREADY knows the signer holds nothing.
 * See {@link refuseWhenTheSignerHoldsNothing}. That is not the modal-opening
 * pre-flight check above, and costs no RPC call: it reads the balance the player
 * is already being shown.
 *
 * Waiting for inclusion matters more than it looks. `writeContract` resolves as soon as
 * the transaction is BROADCAST, so without this a commitment that reverts (an
 * empty reserve, a bond the reserve cannot cover) would still resolve happily,
 * the round would call itself Committed, and the only symptom would be a
 * baffling `NothingToReveal` a phase later. The round's states are what the
 * player is told about something they have money on, so they have to mean what
 * they say.
 *
 * The cast is doing one specific job: viem types `value` differently for a
 * PAYABLE function than the tracked client's `writeContract` generic expects.
 * Nothing about the VALUE is wrong - commit and reveal are payable in the ABI
 * and neither sends ether.
 */
/**
 * Refuse a move the signer demonstrably cannot pay for, BEFORE it is sent.
 *
 * A DOOMED SEND IS NOT FREE, which is the whole reason this exists. On the local
 * node this game develops and tests against, a transaction the node REJECTS for
 * want of gas still advances that account's pending nonce, permanently: the
 * account is then wedged, because every later transaction is built at a nonce
 * the chain will never reach, gets a hash, and is never mined. Reproduced in
 * isolation, with no app code involved, in
 * `work/notes/findings/a-rejected-transaction-burns-a-nonce-on-edr.md` (the
 * `work` branch, as ADR-0004 records):
 * drain an account, send, watch the send be refused and `pending` go up anyway.
 * `hardhat_setNonce` will not put it back.
 *
 * The cost of that lands squarely on the feature this file is most careful
 * about: the player tops up, the round retries, and the retry can never mine, so
 * a stake that was recoverable is lost to a stuck `Committing` instead. That is
 * the exact failure `out-of-gas.e2e.ts` exists to prevent, arriving through the
 * remedy rather than the original fault.
 *
 * THE CHECK IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, and reads as an assertion about the app
 * rather than about the chain. It fires only when the balance the player is
 * ALREADY being shown says zero: a store that has loaded, and loaded a nought.
 * So it costs no RPC round trip, it cannot contradict the UI (if it refuses, the
 * screen is already offering the top-up), and an unloaded or stale store simply
 * falls through to the behaviour below, which is what shipped before this.
 *
 * It does NOT try to answer "can this afford THIS move", which would need a gas
 * estimate on a per-move path and would still be a guess. A partially funded
 * signer can still be rejected by the node and still burn a nonce there. That is
 * a smaller window and a node defect rather than this app's, and paying an
 * estimate on every commit and every reveal to narrow it is not a trade worth
 * making silently.
