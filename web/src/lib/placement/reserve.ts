/**
 * The reserve: the tokens a player puts at risk in order to play.
 *
 * This is the template's answer to the second commit-reveal rule - something
 * must be at stake, or nobody has to reveal. A player who dislikes what they
 * committed to can always go quiet; the bond taken from this reserve at commit
 * time, and forfeited by `acknowledgeMissedReveal`, is what makes that cost
 * them. A game that gates differently (holding custody of an item the player
 * bought, say) replaces this file; the framework only requires that SOMETHING
 * is lost.
 *
 * This READS the stake and takes it back out. Putting one there is the
 * acquisition rail's job (`$lib/game/acquire`, wired through
 * `./acquisition.ts`), because acquiring a stake is the same shape in every
 * game and getting it wrong costs the player money. It used to be `fund()`
 * here: mint, approve, add to the reserve, three transactions the wallet asked
 * about one at a time with nothing on screen explaining why there were three,
 * and no memory of any of them across a reload.
