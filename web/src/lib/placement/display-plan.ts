/**
 * Keeping the player's own turn on screen until the board takes it over.
 *
 * The framework decides WHEN (`game/core/handover.ts`), and it decides it once
 * for both halves of the handover, which is the only way the two can be
 * guaranteed to agree. This is the game's half: what a remembered turn LOOKS
 * like on this board.
 *
 * BEFORE the round resolves the planned cells are drawn from the round's own
 * actions. AFTER it resolves they are drawn from the board, which is holding
 * them back until every reveal has landed (`./hold.ts`). The round drops its
 * actions the moment it reaches `Revealed`, so without this the planned
 * markers vanish while the board still shows the cells unclaimed, and a player
 * who placed on an EMPTY cell watches their placement disappear completely for
 * the rest of the reveal window - the planned marker is the only thing drawing
 * it, and the confirmed one is being withheld on purpose.
 *
 * FOR DISPLAY ONLY. The HUD's planned count, its Clear button and everything
 * else that acts on a turn keep reading the round, because once a turn is
 * committed there is nothing left to undo.
