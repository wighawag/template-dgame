/**
 * What this game holds back while a round resolves.
 *
 * The framework owns the WHEN (`game/core/handover.ts`: hold during the wait,
 * release when the round is over, and publish the release so the local overlay
 * can hand over in the same propagation). This is the one thing it cannot own:
 * which parts of THIS game's board the resolving round changed.
 *
 * Here the board is cells with an accumulated stake and a claimant count, and
 * during a reveal window the only thing on chain that touches either is a
 * reveal of the round being resolved. A commitment places nothing - it is a
 * hash - and the contract refuses a reveal once the epoch has turned over. So
 * "what this round changed" is simply "whatever changed", and the rule is that
 * a cell already on screen keeps the value it had when the round began.
 *
 * A CELL THAT WAS NOT ON SCREEN IS HIDDEN, which is the opposite of what a
 * game with long-lived entities should do, and the difference is worth stating
 * because it is the same fork in the road either way. A cell can be absent
 * from the shown board for two reasons: it was claimed by a reveal that just
 * landed, or the player panned onto a region that was never fetched. Nothing
 * on this board tells the two apart. Showing it would leak exactly what this
 * exists to hide, because on an open board "a cell became claimed" IS the
 * round's outcome and is the common case rather than a rare one. Hiding it
 * costs a player who pans mid-window a few seconds of empty cells in a region
 * they cannot act on anyway, since planning is locked while the round
 * resolves.
 *
 * A game whose entities PERSIST should choose the other way and say so: there,
 * hiding an entity that was merely panned onto removes something that has been
 * standing in the world since before the round began, which is worse than
 * showing one arrival early.
 *
 * Pure, so the four cases that matter (changed, unchanged, newly claimed,
 * newly visible) are node tests rather than something to squint at during a
 * ten second reveal window.
