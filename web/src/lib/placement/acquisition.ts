/**
 * What this game acquires, and how: the seam the acquisition rail plugs into.
 *
 * The template gates on a token reserve bonded at commit time and forfeited by
 * `acknowledgeMissedReveal`, so what a new player has to get is a stake. That
 * used to be three transactions they were never told about - mint, approve,
 * add to the reserve - each signed in the wallet, with nothing on screen saying
 * why there were three. `StakeSale.purchase` is one call that does all of it
 * AND funds the local signer's gas in the same transaction, which is what lets
 * the rail above this file be one transaction end to end.
 *
 * A game that gates differently (custody of an item the player bought, a pass)
 * replaces this file and nothing else: the rail takes the address, the function
 * name, the price, the stipend and the arguments, and has no opinion about what
 * arrives.
