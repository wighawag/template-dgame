/**
 * A commitment the player never revealed.
 *
 * The contract keeps one open commitment per player. If a reveal phase passes
 * without one, that commitment stays on the books and every later
 * `makeCommitment` reverts with `PreviousCommitmentNotRevealed`. Nothing
 * resolves it on its own, so a player who misses a single reveal - closes the
 * tab at the wrong moment, loses their connection - is locked out of the game
 * until someone calls `acknowledgeMissedReveal`.
 *
 * That call FORFEITS THE BOND, so it is the player's to make.
 *
 * This was briefly done automatically, as a quiet fix-up at the start of the
 * next commit. That was wrong in two ways at once: it spent the player's money
 * inside a transaction they thought was about something else, and it meant they
 * were never told they had missed a reveal or what it had cost them. Losing a
 * stake is the single most important thing this app can have to say to someone.
 * So it is surfaced, explained, and waits for a deliberate press.
 *
 * The chain is the authority here, not the local round: clearing site data or
 * playing from another browser loses the local memory of the round, while the
 * contract still holds the commitment.
 *
 * ONE READ, TWO QUESTIONS, and the second one used to be thrown away. Asking
 * `getCommitment` answers "am I blocked?" - a commitment left over from an
 * EARLIER epoch - and it equally answers "is there a commitment for the round
 * in progress that this browser knows nothing about?". That second answer is
 * the one that costs the stake, and it was being reported as `Clear` and
 * dropped, because blocking was the only thing anyone had ever asked. It is
 * published as {@link MissedRevealStore.commitment} now and `./recover-round`
 * is what does something with it. Nothing extra is fetched.
