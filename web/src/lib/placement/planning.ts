/**
 * Turning clicks into a plan.
 *
 * The plan itself lives in the framework's round (it is what gets hashed, and

 * translates "the player clicked cell X" into a new list of placements, and
 * exposes that list in the shape the view merge wants.
 *
 * Deliberately plain TypeScript with Svelte stores at the boundary: components
 * import this rather than doing any of it themselves.
