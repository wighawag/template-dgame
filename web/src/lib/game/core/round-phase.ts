/**
 * Which part of the round it is, in the terms a PLAYER experiences.
 *
 * The contract has two phases and the epoch tracker reports three (`ThreePhase`
 * in `./epoch.ts`: the move window, the lock while commitments land, the
 * reveal). Neither is what the screen has to say, because there is a fourth
 * state that the clock cannot see: the board is showing a round that is already
 * over, because a fetch for the new one has not landed yet.
 *
 * A two-state model (play / wait) is fine to play on and useless to debug
 * against, and it has no slot for the fourth at all - so the catch-up gets
 * reported as "wait", and a player watching a stale board is told the round is
 * resolving when in fact nothing is being waited for except a poll.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES ARE FRAMEWORK. The epoch model is the framework's, so the
 * consequences of it are too; and every game on this template would discover
 * this identically, because the gap between a client clock and a chain that
 * mines on transactions is a property of the arrangement rather than of any
 * game. What a game owns is what it DRAWS: `game/ui/GameClock.svelte` is one
 * offered dial, and a game that wants another writes it against this type.

 * on transactions that block is the next player's commit - so the catch-up
 * lasts twenty seconds while the data it is waiting for arrived immediately.
 * Nothing the board reads can change in that gap: a reveal mined after the
 * boundary is refused (it lands in a commit phase), and a commit moves nothing,
 * so anything that DOES change state mines the block itself.
