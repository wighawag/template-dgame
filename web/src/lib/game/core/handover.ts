/**
 * The handover between the local round and the board.
 *
 * A turn in a commit-reveal game is drawn twice by two different things, and
 * the moment they change hands is not free. BEFORE the round resolves, what is
 * on screen is LOCAL INTENT, built from the actions the round is carrying.
 * AFTER it resolves, the same turn is drawn from the BOARD, which is whatever
 * the game's onchain-state store says. Both halves of that swap are here,
 * because they have to happen at the SAME moment and there is exactly one way
 * to guarantee that: publish the moment rather than letting each side work out
 * "roughly now" for itself.
 *
 * Two framework facts make this a framework problem rather than one game's
 * cosmetic bug, and every game on this template would hit both.
 *
 * **A round is SIMULTANEOUS and its reveals are not.** That is the whole
 * reason to pay for commitments at all: everyone's turn resolves together. But
 * the reveals arrive one transaction at a time, in whatever order the mempool
 * delivers them, so a board that applies each one as it lands shows the round
 * playing out in the order players PAID, drawn as if it were the order they
 * acted in. It is not what happened, and it leaks who was quick to reveal.
 * {@link holdBoardUntilRoundEnds} withholds the resolving round's changes
 * until the round is over, and then lets them out together.
 *
 * **The round drops its actions at `Revealed`.** {@link RoundState} carries
 * them at every step up to and including `Revealing` and not after, which is
 * correct - there is nothing left to change - but it means the local overlay
 * vanishes the instant the reveal transaction lands, seconds before the board
 * is willing to show what that transaction did. Between those two moments a
 * player is shown NEITHER copy of their own turn. {@link rememberTurn} is the
 * smallest memory that closes it, and {@link heldTurnUntilBoardReleases} ties
 * that memory to the board's own release signal.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately: what counts as "this round's outcome" for a
 * particular game's state, and what a turn LOOKS like. The first is the
 * `hold` callback below, because it is a statement about the game's own entity
 * shape; the second is whatever the game merges into its view. The seam falls
 * where it does everywhere else on this template: the framework owns the
 * consequences of its own model (a round with phases, a board with an epoch),
 * and the game owns its content.

 * - **Prefer showing something over hiding it when the inputs are

 *   fail to fetch will, on the fetch that fails, either blank a live board or
 *   release the whole round early. Decide from the read that carries the state
