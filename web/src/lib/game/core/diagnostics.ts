/**
 * A running commentary on the things that flash past.
 *
 * WHY IT SUBSCRIBES RATHER THAN INSTRUMENTS, and this is the reason it is
 * framework rather than one app's helper. Everything traced here lives in
 * `core/` and `game/core/`, which a descendant inherits byte for byte, and
 * keeping it that way is what makes merging from upstream free. Sprinkling log
 * lines through those files would trade that for a permanent merge conflict in
 * every file touched, in every repo downstream, forever. Every fact below is
 * already published as a store, so watching from OUTSIDE costs nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR, concretely. The faults it was written for are over before
 * they can be described: a modal that appears and vanishes during a signed
 * transaction, and a "data may be stale" bar showing for a second or two. Both
 * are TRANSITIONS, not states, so the only way to catch one is to timestamp
 * every transition and read it back beside a recording.
 *
 * Each line carries `+Nms` since the previous line in its own namespace, which
 * is the number that matters when the question is "what did that modal follow?"
 * rather than "what time was it?".
 *
 * TURNING IT ON: `?debug=diag:*&debugLevel=debug`. The sharp edges are in
 * `web/README.md`: a bare `?debug` does nothing, the level defaults to warn so
 * the namespaces alone are silent, and the namespace selection persists while
 * the level does not.
 *
 * None of that machinery is here or anywhere in the app: the inline script in
 * `src/app.html` builds the factory and parses the URL before the first module
 * runs. Do NOT call `hookup()` from a module to "fix" logging that looks inert
 * - it installs a second factory over `globalThis._logFactory`, freshly
 * defaulted, silently undoing whatever the URL just asked for.
 *
 * WHERE THE SEAM IS. This watches what every app on this template has: the
 * core services, and the round. What a GAME adds to the same trace - which
 * entity is being played, what its own flows are doing - is its own, and it
 * adds it by calling {@link watch} beside {@link startCoreDiagnostics}. See
 * `$lib/debug/diagnostics.ts`, which is the app-level file every descendant
 * keeps.
