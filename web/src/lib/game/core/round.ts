/**
 * The commit-reveal round.
 *
 * This is framework, not a seam. It owns the part every game on this template
 * shares: what the player has planned for this epoch, when that stops being
 * changeable, keeping the secret until it is time to disclose it, and getting
 * the reveal out. What it does NOT know is how to call the contract - that is
 * the `CommitRevealAdapter` the game supplies.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing rather than convenient.
 *
 * **The reveal is driven, not offered.** A missed reveal costs the player
 * whatever the game put at stake, and the reveal phase can be seconds long. A
 * UI that merely enables a button and hopes the player is watching would take
 * that for a mistake the machine could have avoided. So entering the reveal
 * phase with a live commitment sends the reveal, unless the game has arranged
 * for something else to (see `autoReveal`).
 *
 * What "at stake" means is the GAME's business, and it varies more than a
 * bonded token: this template forfeits a token bond, stratagems burns reserve,
 * and conquest and catacombs intend to dock levels from a character the player
 * paid for, which degrades their position rather than taking a deposit. The
 * framework only needs it to be true that not revealing costs something.
 *
 * **The secret is persisted before the commitment is sent, not after.** It is
 * the only thing that can open the commitment; if a reload can lose it, the
 * player is guaranteed to forfeit, and the window where that is possible is
 * exactly the moment the tab is busiest. Writing it first means the worst case
 * is a stored secret for a commitment that never landed, which is harmless.
