/**
 * WHEN THE BOARD REFRESHES ITSELF, beyond the poller's own interval.
 *
 * A fixed interval plus "refetch when the scope changes" is the right policy
 * for most of a round and the wrong one at both of its edges. Two moments,
 * both reported from play rather than found by testing:
 *
 * DURING THE REVEAL WINDOW. Everything on the board changes at exactly one
 * moment in an epoch: the reveal phase, as each player's commitment resolves,
 * one transaction at a time. A browser that does not itself hold the round (a
 * second player watching, the same player in another window) has nothing local
 * to tell it any of that happened, so it learns about a move up to a whole
 * interval late. At a 5s interval that reads as the board ignoring the reveal
 * until the next round has already started. {@link refreshDuringReveal} runs a
 * short cadence for the window instead.
 *
 * AT THE ROUND BOUNDARY. The client's clock interpolates from the wall clock
 * between blocks, so it crosses into the new epoch BEFORE the chain has mined a
 * block past it. The poller asks for the new epoch, the contract answers from
 * its latest block with the old one, and a reader that requires an exact match
 * refuses the read. The catch-up budget then expires, the refusal reaches the
 * polling store as a FAILED fetch, and exponential backoff starts behind an
 * RPC-health banner - over a board that was never anything worse than a moment
 * behind. {@link settleBoardWhenRoundStarts} retries at a short cadence until
 * the board has actually caught up, which is bomber-world's retry-until-success
 * expressed as a policy with a budget.
 *
 * BOTH ARE FRAMEWORK, not app wiring. The epoch model is the framework's, so
 * the consequences of it are too: a game should not have to discover either of
 * these for itself, and every game on this template would discover them
 * identically. `onchain/state.ts` runs them for its poller; they live here,
 * apart from it, because they are policies over two stores and a callback, and
 * that is what makes them testable without a chain, a camera or an app context.

/**

 * four-part model the HUD reads). Two types with one name in one repo is a
 * mistake waiting for whoever imports the wrong one, and neither compiler nor
 * reviewer would notice: both are structurally about phases.
 *
 * Structurally a subset of {@link TwoPhase}, so the epoch tracker's output
 * satisfies it directly and these policies stay testable with an object

 * resolves at reveal - so outside the window and its grace this is off, and a

 * belong to whichever window holds them.
 *
 * THE FETCH RETRIES RATHER THAN GIVING UP, which is the actual fix. See the
 * file comment: the client crosses the boundary before the chain does, and a
 * poller that treats "not yet" as a failure backs off behind a health banner
 * while the new round is visibly underway on last round's board.
 *
 * ONE ATTEMPT PER ROUND, with a budget. If the chain is so far behind that the
 * budget expires, this gives up and the background poller owns the recovery;
 * nothing promises a catch-up that is not happening.
 *
 * `watch()` rather than subscribing at construction, because subscribing to a
 * phase derived from chain time starts the chain clock, and ADR-0002 forbids IO
