/**
 * A commit secret DERIVED from a key the player already holds, rather than
 * randomised.
 *
 * The framework's default secret is 32 random bytes (`randomSecret` in
 * `round.ts`). It is safe, and it is unrecoverable: it exists only in local
 * storage, so a player who clears site data between the commit and the reveal
 * cannot open their own commitment. In a game with a stake that is not a
 * nuisance, it is the stake.
 *
 * A derived secret is a signature over a message that names the round, hashed.
 * The same key produces the same signature, so the secret can be recomputed on
 * another device, or in the same browser after its storage is gone.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT RECOVER, and it is half the problem rather than a detail:
 * the ACTIONS. A commitment is `hash(secret, actions)` and the chain holds only
 * the hash, so the plan is not recoverable from anything here. Where a game's
 * action space is small enough it can be recovered by ENUMERATION once the
 * secret is in hand, and that is the game's own code because only the game
 * knows its space. Where it cannot, "recoverable" honestly means "a device that
 * still has the plan". See `games-on-this-foundation.md` D9 on the template's
 * `work` branch.

 *
 * It MUST be the same key on every device the player recovers from, which in
 * this template is the local signer: sign-in derives it from a signature over

 * a game uses to recover its own actions, and the only thing separating the two
