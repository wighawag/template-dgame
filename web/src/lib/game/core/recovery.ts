/**
 * A commitment the chain holds and this browser has no round for.
 *
 * NOT a storage feature, which is the thing to get right before reading any of
 * it. A cleared browser, a second device, a second browser, a private window, a
 * reinstall and a storage write that silently failed all produce the same
 * state: the contract is holding a commitment, the reveal is owed this epoch,
 * and nothing here knows about it. A second device is not a mode, so this is
 * not a mode's feature - and left unhandled it costs the stake, in silence,
 * which is the most expensive thing this app can do to someone.
 *
 * THE CHAIN READ IS ALREADY THERE. `./missed-reveal.ts` asks `getCommitment`
 * on every epoch turn to find out whether the player is BLOCKED, and until now
 * it threw the live answer away: a commitment for the current epoch is not
 * blocking anything, so it reported `Clear` and returned. That branch is the
 * silent forfeit. Nothing extra is fetched for any of this.
 *
 * THE SECRET COMES BACK ON ITS OWN, because it is derived from the local
 * signer rather than stored (`game/core/secret.ts`), and the signer is itself
 * derived from a signature the wallet produces deterministically. So the same
 * account signing in anywhere recomputes the same secret for the same epoch.
 * That is the prerequisite this rests on and it landed first.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT COME BACK IS THE PLAN, because the chain holds only a hash.
 * Three routes exist and THIS FILE JUDGES ALL THREE THE SAME WAY, which is why
 * it is framework: local storage still has it (the ordinary reload, and nothing
 * here runs); the game ENUMERATES it, where its action space is small enough;
 * or the PLAYER re-enters it. Whichever produced the candidate, what settles it
 * is `buildCommitment` against the chain's hash, and that is one comparison.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and the list is D10's: no chain reader, no modal, and no
 * enumeration budget. The game supplies the commitment it read, the words it
 * says, and its own search if it has one. What the framework owns is the part
 * that was going to be written identically in every game - offer, check,
 * adopt - and the two ways of getting that subtly wrong, which are both
 * silent.
 *
 * TOO LATE IS NOT A CASE. `epochDuration = commitPhaseDuration +
 * revealPhaseDuration` with no trailing segment, so a commitment in the
 * CURRENT epoch is always still openable: the player is either in the commit
 * phase or in the reveal phase. Once the reveal window shuts the epoch has
 * advanced, and the game's missed-reveal path reports it and offers the
 * settlement the player presses for themselves. Only the live epoch was ever
 * missing.
 *
 * **D10 SCOPED THE FRAMEWORK TO ONE METHOD AND THAT WAS TOO TIGHT**, which was
 * only knowable once a second game wanted this. The decision's reasoning holds
 * exactly as written - the isolation requirement, no new `RoundState` member,
 * the game keeping its chain read and its enumeration - and the sentence that
 * was wrong is the one that put the offer-and-check beside them. It is
 * identical in both games, down to the two silent failure modes below, and a
 * thing written twice in this tree is a thing that should have been moved.
