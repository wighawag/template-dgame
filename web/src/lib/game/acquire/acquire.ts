/**
 * Acquiring what lets you play: one transaction, a gas stipend, recoverable.
 *
 * Every game on this template gates entry on something. It has to: a player
 * who dislikes what they committed to can simply go quiet, so unless holding a
 * position costs something, nobody has to reveal. WHAT that something is varies
 * (a bonded token reserve, custody of an item the player bought, a pass), and
 * this file does not care. What every one of them shares is the shape of
 * getting it, and that shape is the whole of this module:
 *
 *   1. the owner SIGNS a delegation. Free, no transaction, and for an account
 *      whose credential was minted at sign-in not even a prompt.
 *   2. the owner sends ONE transaction, which acquires the thing and forwards a
 *      stipend to this browser's local signer in the same call.
 *   3. the SIGNER registers itself, paying out of the stipend it just received.
 *
 * ONE TRANSACTION IS THE POINT, and it is not a nicety. The alternative asks
 * for two transactions from the owner, and on a fresh wallet two faucet claims:
 * the first sends almost everything the faucet gave to the signer, and the
 * second then finds an empty wallet. Folding the authorisation into a signature
 * is what removes the second one, and it is strictly better for an account that
 * has no wallet to prompt at all.
 *
 * Step 3 failing is survivable and deliberately not rolled back: the player has
 * what they paid for and this browser is not yet authorised, which is exactly
 * the state a separate `authorise` step exists for.
 *
 * Unlike a move, this SPENDS THE PLAYER'S OWN MONEY, so it goes through
 * `accountExecutor` and prompts the wallet, and through `balanceCheck` so a
 * player who cannot cover it is told before signing rather than after. Moves go
 * the other way (silent, signer-paid) and the game's commit-reveal adapter
 * explains why.
 *
 * WHAT A GAME SUPPLIES is {@link Acquisition}: where the call goes, what it
 * costs, and how to build it. Nothing else here is game-specific, which is why
 * it lives beside the round rather than in any one game's directory.
