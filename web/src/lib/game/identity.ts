/**
 * WHAT THIS GAME KEYS A ROUND BY.
 *
 * The framework never names a concrete identity: `createRound`,
 * `CommitRevealAdapter`, `createDerivedSecret` and `createRoundRecovery` are
 * all generic over `TIdentity extends PlayerIdentity`, deliberately, because
 * the games this template exists for disagree about what a player IS. An
 * account-keyed game plays as an address; reveal-or-die and bomber-world
 * commit per ERC721 token; conquest commits per owner-derived empire id.
 *
 * So SOMETHING has to say which one this app chose, and this module is it.
 * It exists so that the choice is made in ONE file rather than spelled out at
 * every site that carries it, and the reason that matters is a merge:
 * `with/nft-identity` is a branch of this repo where the reference game becomes
 * token-keyed, and every shared file that names `0x${string}` as the identity
 * would be a file that branch has to edit and therefore conflict on forever.
 * `core/connection/mode.ts` is the proven version of the same pattern, where
 * `TARGET_STEP` is one constant and one line of difference across three
 * branches. See rules N1 to N3 of Decision 3 in the plan on the `work` branch.
 *
 * TWO WORDS THAT ARE NOT THE SAME WORD, and conflating them is the mistake
 * this module exists to make impossible:
 *
 * - the ACCOUNT is who signed in. It owns things, it pays, and it is an
 *   address in every game and every configuration. `Game.identity` is that,
 *   and so are `acquire`'s `owner`, the reserve's `payer` and everything in
 *   `onchain/delegation.ts`.
 * - the GAME IDENTITY is who PLAYS. The round, the commitment, the secret's
 *   domain separation, the stake and the round's storage key are all keyed by
 *   it, and it is what changes shape between games.
 *
 * ON `main` THEY HOLD THE SAME VALUE, because the template is deliberately an
 * address game (decision 3 in HANDOFF). That is exactly why the names have to
 * be separated HERE and now: while the two are equal, nothing forces a caller
 * to say which one it meant, so the day they stop being equal every one of
 * those sites has to be re-read and judged. Separating the names while the
 * values agree is free; separating the values first is not.

/**
 * THE ONE LINE.
 *
 * This is the whole difference between an address game and a token game, and
 * `with/nft-identity` changes it to `bigint`. Nothing else in this file, and
 * nothing in `game/core/`, has to move for that.
 *
 * A descendant that keys by a token does the same thing in its own copy of
 * this file: reveal-or-die's is `bigint`, which is the entire identity
 * difference between that repo and this one.

 * with. The setup gate turns that into an instruction instead of a dead board.
 *
 * A plain `Readable` and nothing more, on purpose. reveal-or-die's equivalent
 * store also offers `select(avatarID)`, because there an account can own
 * several avatars and somebody has to pick; adding `select` here would ship a
 * capability upstream that no consumer on `main` can exercise, since there is

/**
 * The identity PROVIDER: where the active identity comes from.
 *
 * D6 requires that identity be a SELECTION rather than a derivation, even
 * where there is exactly one of them, so that several identities per account
 * stays cheap to add later. What that rule actually demands is that every
 * consumer take an `ActiveIdentityStore` and that nothing reconstruct the
 * identity from the account for itself - which is what the rest of this app
 * now does. This function is where the one construction lives.
 *
 * THIS GAME DOES NOT CHOOSE. It is an address game, so there is exactly one
 * identity per account and it is the account's own address; the honest
 * description is not "the identity is the account" but "this game has one
 * identity per account, and that is its address".
 *
 * A GAME THAT DOES CHOOSE REPLACES THIS FUNCTION, and that is the shape to
 * expect rather than a signature with a selection parameter bolted on. The
 * evidence is reveal-or-die, which was checked rather than guessed at: its
 * identity comes from `world/active-avatar.ts`, a store that reads what the
 * account has in custody, drops avatars with no life left, prefers one
 * already in the world and remembers the choice per owner across reloads.
 * None of that can be passed in as a list of candidates, and a `candidates`
 * parameter here would have been an unexercised guess at a shape the one real
 * consumer does not have. So a choosing game supplies its own store, and the
 * only thing this module insists on is the TYPE it has to satisfy.
