<!--
	The phase dial: one offered way to draw `RoundPhase`.

	The thing a player looks at constantly, and a pie reads faster than a bar.
	PROPS ONLY, deliberately: no context, no stores, no game concepts, so it can
	sit anywhere and be tested without an app. Everything it would otherwise have
	to decide belongs in the HUD model that feeds it.

	A game that wants a different dial writes one against `RoundPhase` and drops
	this; the framework's claim is over the four-part MODEL
	(`game/core/round-phase.ts`), not over the picture.

	TWO OVERALL STATES, as it always was - green while the round is yours to
	change, red once it is resolving - plus ONE transient colour: the catch-up
	flashes blue for the moment between the round changing and the fetch for it
	landing. That one earns a colour of its own because it is the only part
	that is neither play nor wait but a REFRESH, and because it is short
	enough that a flash reads truer than a colour that lingers. WHICH of the
	red parts it is shows in the label beside the dial and in its countdown,
	not in a third shade of red: a player acts on "can I move?", and only a
	debugger wants the finer split.

	`#game-clock` is a stable id so that a tour or a test can point at it.
