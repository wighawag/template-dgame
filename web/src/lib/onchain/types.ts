// Each game define their OnchainState interface
// the OnchainLayer listen from a view parameter s(camera, etc...)

// what state can be retrived and modified locally : we try to anticipate the pending layer

// Actions generate PendingActions
// it is a object that has a list of function, upon executing them a actionId along with a way to retrived its completion is returned and emitted.
// it is chain specific and game specific, but we can probably extract the chain specicif part

// Each game define their Actions interface

// PendingActionStore listen for PendingActions and emit changes to them
// this store listen to PendingActions and check for their completion, etc..
// it emits the changes

// PendingOnchainLayyer depends on OnChainLayer + PendingActionStore
// it merge the OnchainLayer with the PendingActions

// is game specific but not chain specific

// ViewLayer is what the game use to render
// it listen to PendingOnchainLayer
