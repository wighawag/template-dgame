/**
 * This game's own additions to the trace.
 *
 * The mechanism and everything the template composes for every app are in
 * `$lib/game/core/diagnostics`: the modal candidates, RPC health and each of
 * its inputs, the signer's balance, the round and the epoch. Read that file
 * first; it is also where the argument for watching from OUTSIDE rather than
 * instrumenting `core/` lives, and it is the reason this file exists at all
 * rather than log lines in inherited code.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE is whatever is this game's own. They go on the `round`
 * namespace beside the round itself, because the question they answer is
 * always relative to it: "the setup gate opened at +0, the purchase finished
 * at +4s, the round committed at +4.2s" is a story, and the same three lines
 * in three namespaces are not.
 *
 * TURNING IT ON: `?debug=diag:*&debugLevel=debug`. The switch is documented in
 * `web/README.md`, which is also where the sharp edges are written down (a bare
 * `?debug` does nothing, the level defaults to warn so the namespaces alone are
 * silent, and the namespace selection persists while the level does not).
