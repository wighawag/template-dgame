/**
 * This app's own additions to the trace.
 *
 * The mechanism and everything the template composes for every app are in
 * `$lib/game/core/diagnostics`: the modal candidates, RPC health and its
 * inputs, the signer's balance, the round and the epoch. Read that file first;
 * it is also where the argument for watching from OUTSIDE rather than
 * instrumenting `core/` lives, and it is the reason a descendant can keep this
 * file without inheriting a merge conflict.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE is whatever is this game's own. They go on the `round`
 * namespace beside the round itself, because the question they answer is
 * always relative to it: "the setup gate opened at +0, the acquisition
 * finished at +4s, the round committed at +4.2s" is a story, and the same
 * three lines in three namespaces are not.
 *
 * A game built from this template replaces the list below with its own and
 * leaves everything else alone.
 *
 * `Context` is accepted here and NOT upstream, deliberately: `context/types.ts`
 * is one of the files a game replaces, so a framework file that named it could
 * not be inherited by the games it exists for. Upstream describes what it needs
 * structurally instead, and this app's `Context` satisfies it with no cast -
 * which is the check that the structural description is honest.
