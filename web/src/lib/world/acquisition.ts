/**
 * What this game acquires, and how: the seam the acquisition rail plugs into.
 *
 * This game stakes an AVATAR the contract holds, so what a new player has to
 * get is one of those. `AvatarsSale.purchase` mints and deposits in a SINGLE
 * transaction: it is given the Game's address as the recipient, so the NFT is
 * minted straight into the contract's custody and `avatarsPerOwner` reports it
 * immediately. There is no separate approve-and-transfer step, and there should
 * not be one, because the two-step version leaves an avatar sitting in a wallet
 * where it does nothing and looks like a bug.
 *
 * The OWNER is carried in `data` rather than being the recipient. That is the
 * whole trick of the arrangement: `to` is where the token goes (the Game), and
 * the encoded address is who it belongs to. `AvatarsSale._executeMint` decodes
 * it and packs it into the token id, which is why the id can be computed here
 * before the transaction is even sent.
 *
 * Everything else - who pays, the consent, the stipend, the signer registering
 * itself afterwards, and finding a purchase that outlived its tab - is
 * `$lib/game/acquire` and is not this game's to write.
