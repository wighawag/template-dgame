/**
 * Recovering a turn this browser forgot, by SEARCHING for it.
 *
 * The framework does the judging (`game/core/recovery.ts`): it is handed a
 * candidate turn, recomputes the secret, hashes it and adopts the round if the
 * hash is the one the chain is holding. What it deliberately does not have is
 * an opinion about where a candidate comes from, because only a game knows
 * whether its turns can be enumerated at all.
 *
 * THIS GAME'S CAN, and it is the only one in the tree that can. A turn is a
 * walk of at most `numMoves` orthogonal steps over walkable cells from where
 * the avatar is standing, optionally ending in an Exit if the walk finishes on
 * the exit tile. The maze is what makes that small: most cells have two ways
 * out, so the search is nothing like the four-to-the-tenth the rule allows.
 *
 * MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, because the plan's estimate was four orders of
 * magnitude out (it said "about 125 candidates", from a three-move turn; the
 * deployments all carry ten). On the generated map, a walk of up to ten steps
 * from a floor cell is **3,000 to 16,000 candidates**, and hashing them costs
 * about **85 microseconds each** - so a recovery is a few tenths of a second to
 * a little over a second, not a minute and not a millisecond.
 *
 * THAT IS WHY THERE IS A BUDGET, and why the budget is here rather than in the
 * framework. Those numbers are this map's, and the rule permits worse: an open
 * chamber with four ways out of every cell is a million candidates and a minute
 * and a half of hashing. A search that cannot finish must stop and say so
 * rather than pin the tab while the reveal window closes, and what it degrades
 * to is the route the reference game uses anyway - ask the player.
 *
 * IT YIELDS, for the same reason. A second of straight-line hashing is a second
 * with no frames, during which nothing on the board moves and no button
 * responds, and this runs at exactly the moment a player is most likely to be
 * doing something about it.
 *
 * THE SECRET IS COMPUTED ONCE, which is not an optimisation. It is derived from
 * a SIGNATURE (`game/core/secret.ts`), so deriving it per candidate would be
 * ten thousand signatures for one turn.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT RECOVER, and it is not a gap to close by searching harder: an
 * ENTRY. An avatar that is not in the world enters at any non-obstacle cell,
 * anywhere, and the map is unbounded - so there is nothing to enumerate over
 * and the fallback is the general route. Stated here because "the action space
 * is small" is true of a turn and false of an entry, and the difference is
 * whether the avatar has a position to start from.
