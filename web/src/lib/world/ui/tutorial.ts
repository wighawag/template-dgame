 * Whether the player has been shown round the board yet, and the tour itself.
 *
 * The flag used to be a field on `private/localState.ts`, the pre-port store
 * that also held the pending round, the chosen avatar and the planned actions.
 * All three of those have proper homes now (the framework's round,
 * `../active-avatar`, `../planning`), and this was the only thing left, so it
 * lives here rather than keeping that module alive for one boolean.
 *
 * Per BROWSER, not per account: it records what this person has already read,
 * and signing in as somebody else does not make them read it again.
