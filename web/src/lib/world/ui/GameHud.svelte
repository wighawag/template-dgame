<!--
	The HUD, drawn over the canvas.

	Logic-less on purpose (see AGENTS.md): everything it shows comes from the
	`HudModel` store, and every button calls straight into the game's stores. If
	a decision has to be made about what to show, it belongs in `hud.ts`.

	This is where the pre-port UI ended up. `GameClock` is the framework's now
	(`$lib/game/ui`), since every game on this template has the same four-part
	round to draw; the phase banners `EnterFlow.svelte` used to paint across the
	bottom of the screen are the `instruction` line, the "Moves: n" box from
	`TopBar` is the moves counter, and the avatar list `EnterFlow` opened in a
	modal is the picker below. What they all had in common was reading the
	context directly and deciding for themselves; none of them do now.
