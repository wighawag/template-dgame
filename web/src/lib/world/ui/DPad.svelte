<!--
	The on-screen controls, for a player with neither a keyboard nor a gamepad.

	A THIRD INPUT DEVICE, not a special case: every button here emits the same
	`ControlIntent` a key or a pad emits, into the same `game.controls`. That is
	the whole reason `$lib/world/controls.ts` exists as its own module, and it is
	what stops a phone and a keyboard disagreeing about what a step is.

	Logic-less by construction (see AGENTS.md): what a direction means, whether a
	step is legal and whether leaving is allowed are all decided behind
	`controls.handle`, and this file only lays out the buttons. Whether it is
	shown at all is `GameHud`'s decision, from the HUD model.

	It replaces the d-pad that was deleted with the pre-port renderer, which
	emitted into a module-level event emitter the canvas also listened to
	(`work:docs/audits/03-renderer.md` 4.8). Nothing here is shared with the canvas.

		The only affordance for the Exit action, which is why it is spelled out
		rather than given an icon. It is the whole point of the exit tile being
		drawn on the map, and until recently the goal was visible and unreachable.

		DISABLED AWAY FROM THE EXIT, because that is now the contract's rule too:
		`_exit` reads the cell under the avatar and drops the action anywhere else,
		which from the player's side would look like a button that did nothing. The
		HUD's instruction line says where the way out is, so the disabled state is
		not the only thing they have to go on.
