/**
 * A commitment from a past epoch that was never revealed.
 *
 * This exists because of a guard this repo re-enabled. `_makeCommitment`
 * rejects a commitment left over from an EARLIER epoch with
 * `PreviousCommitmentNotRevealed`, so an avatar that went quiet cannot play
 * again until the player acknowledges it. Without something watching for that,
 * the only symptom is every commit failing with a bare revert.
 *
 * Note what this is NOT. The template's equivalent reports a FORFEIT: its
 * `acknowledgeMissedReveal` burns the bond, so the store is telling the player
 * what it cost them. Here it costs nothing today (`_acknowledgeMissedReveal`
 * carries `TODO burn / stake` and forfeits nothing), so this is about
 * UNBLOCKING play rather than reporting a loss. If a forfeit is added later,
 * this is where it gets surfaced.
 *
 * ONE READ, TWO QUESTIONS, and the second one used to be thrown away. Asking
 * `getCommitment` answers "am I blocked?" - a commitment left over from an
 * EARLIER epoch - and it equally answers "is there a commitment for the round
 * in progress that this browser knows nothing about?". The second is the one
 * that costs a turn and, three of them in a row, the avatar; it was being
 * reported as `Clear` and dropped, because blocking was the only thing anyone
 * had ever asked. It is published as {@link MissedRevealStore.commitment} now
 * and `world/recover-round.ts` is what does something with it. Nothing extra is
 * fetched.
