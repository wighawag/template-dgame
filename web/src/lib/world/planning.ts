/**
 * Turning clicks into a plan.
 *
 * The plan itself lives in the framework's round (it is what gets hashed, and
 * it has to survive a reload), so this keeps no second copy. It only translates
 * "the player clicked here" into a new list of actions, and exposes that list
 * in the shape the view merge wants.
 *
 * The rules below are the CONTRACT'S rules, mirrored. That is the whole point
 * of doing it here: `_move` refusing a step sets `stopProcessing`, which drops
 * every remaining action in the same reveal, so one bad step planned by mistake
 * silently discards the rest of the turn and tells the player nothing. Refusing
 * to plan it is the only place that can be prevented.
