/**
 * Finding a purchase this browser has already paid for.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A FLAG IN A STORE. `purchase.ts` holds the state of an
 * attempt, and a store dies with the tab. Reload while the transaction is in
 * flight and the setup gate went back to "Buy an avatar" for someone whose
 * money was already spent: `subID` is random, so a second attempt does not
 * collide with the first, it mints a SECOND avatar and charges again.
 *
 * The evidence that a purchase exists is a transaction, and this app already
 * keeps a durable, per-account record of transactions: the operations ledger in
 * account data, which is what the signer's own moves are recovered from across
 * a reload. So this reads THAT rather than writing a second copy of it beside
 * it. Writing the subID (or a "purchasing" flag) into local storage would be
 * exactly that second copy, with its own staleness, its own cleanup and its own
 * way of disagreeing with the chain.
 *
 * It became possible only recently: until the payment rail's client was wrapped
 * by the tracker upstream, a purchase paid from a second wallet never reached
 * the ledger at all. See work:docs/plans/web-port.md.
 *
 * Pure and taking a snapshot, so the whole rule is testable without a chain, a
 * browser or an app context.
