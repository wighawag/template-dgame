/**
 * Keeping the player's own turn on screen until the board takes it over.
 *
 * A turn is drawn twice, by two different things, and the handover between
 * them used to have a hole in it several seconds wide.
 *
 * BEFORE the round resolves, what the player sees is LOCAL INTENT: the planned
 * dots, the ring on the cell they will leave from, and - for an avatar that is
 * not in the world yet - the entering preview, an entity `mergeWorldView`
 * invents because there is nothing on chain behind it. All of that comes from
 * the round's own actions (`world/planning.ts`).
 *
 * AFTER the round resolves, the same turn is drawn from the BOARD: the avatar
 * stands where the chain says, and `AvatarObject` replays the accepted path.
 *
 * The hole is that the two changed hands at different moments. The round DROPS
 * its actions the instant it reaches `Revealed`, so the local overlay vanished
 * as soon as the reveal transaction landed - while the board's version of the
 * same turn is deliberately held back until the round is over
 * (`world/hold.ts`, and holding it is the whole reason reveals are not drawn in
 * the order they were paid for). Between those two moments the player was
 * shown neither: the planned path disappeared while their avatar sat at its old
 * cell, and a player who had planned an ENTRY watched their avatar disappear
 * completely for the rest of the reveal window, because the entering preview is
 * the only thing drawing it and the real one is being withheld on purpose.
 *
 * So the display copy of the plan survives until the board RELEASES, and the
 * release is the board's own signal rather than a second guess at when it
 * happens - see `HeldBoard.holding`. Two computations of "roughly now" would
 * disagree by a frame or a poll and reproduce exactly this bug.
 *
 * FOR DISPLAY ONLY. Nothing that CONTROLS a turn reads this: the HUD's planned
 * count, its Undo and Clear buttons, `movesLeft` and every affordance in
 * `world/controls.ts` keep reading the round, because once a turn is committed
 * there is nothing left to undo and a held display copy must not make the HUD
 * offer it.
 *
 * THE MEMORY IS THE FRAMEWORK'S. The round dropping its actions at `Revealed`
 * is a fact about the round, so `game/core/handover.ts` owns remembering the
 * turn and deciding the moment - the same moment the board releases on, which
 * is the whole point. What is left here is this game's half: what a remembered
 * turn LOOKS like on this board.
