/**
 * What the turn that just resolved actually DID.
 *
 * The round reports `{step: 'Revealed', epoch}` and nothing else, so the HUD
 * used to say "Revealed. Your avatar has moved." after every reveal - after a
 * turn that entered the world, after one that left it, and after the empty
 * turns the round commits by itself to keep an idle avatar alive
 * (`commitWhenIdle`). A player standing still watched their avatar be told it
 * had moved, once an epoch, forever.
 *
 * The actions are on the round state right up to the reveal (`Revealing`
 * carries them) and gone the moment it succeeds, so something has to have been
 * WATCHING. That memory is the framework's - the round dropping its actions is
 * a fact about the round, and `world/display-plan.ts` needs exactly the same
 * thing - so it is `rememberTurn` in `game/core/handover.ts` and this file
 * keeps only the vocabulary, which is entirely this game's.
 *
 * WHAT THE HUD SAYS ABOUT IT now prefers what the chain ACCEPTED, when it is
 * on the board. `lib/world/state.ts` fetches `CommitmentRevealed` for the
 * camera's zones, which carries `actions[0:numActionsResolved]` - the prefix
 * the contract carried out, a step it refused being simply absent - so a turn
 * that walked into a wall is two moves, not three. The remembered actions
 * remain the fallback for the one player whose avatar may not be in the
 * fetched zones at all, and they are the same thing whenever the contract
 * accepted everything.
