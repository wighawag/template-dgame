/**
 * What a control MEANS in this game.
 *
 * The other half of `$lib/game/render/{keys,gamepad,intents}`, and the half
 * that stays here. The recognisers there say "a direction was pressed"; this
 * says that a direction is a step from the end of the plan, that the secondary
 * action is leaving the world, and that cancel takes back the last thing
 * planned. Same split as the pointer's: `game/render/gestures.ts` emits a click
 * and `context/game.ts` decides which cell it is.
 *
 * The recognisers used to be a copy of the template's, in `$lib/input/`,
 * written here first and re-written upstream instead of moved. They were
 * identical bar their comments; this file now imports the INHERITED ones and
 * the copy is gone. See `docs/plans/games-on-this-foundation.md`, decision 2.
 *
 * One mapping for every device, deliberately. The keyboard, a gamepad and the
 * on-screen d-pad all arrive here as intents, so there is one place where the
 * game's rules about a press live, and a fourth device costs nothing. The
 * previous build had the keyboard and the gamepad each reaching into the game
 * through their own handlers, which is how they came to disagree.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DECIDE. The window in which a press is legal is not
 * re-derived here: `planning` already refuses anything the contract would
 * refuse, and `round.commit()` already refuses a commit outside the phase, with
 * nothing planned, or from a step that cannot commit. Asking those questions
 * again would be a second copy of an answer that exists, and the two copies
 * would eventually differ.
