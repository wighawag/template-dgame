 * `mergeWorldView` rebuilds every `AvatarView` on every derive, so by reference
 * every avatar changes each time the poller returns, whether or not anything
 * moved. On a busy board that is the difference between redrawing nothing and
 * redrawing everything, several times a minute.
 *
 * `isPlayer` is compared because it decides how the avatar is drawn. It used to
 * be pushed in through a separate call on every emission, which meant it was
 * NOT part of what the diff compared, and an avatar that became the player's
 * without otherwise changing would keep drawing as somebody else's.
 *
 * `owner` is compared even though an avatar's owner rarely changes, because it
 * chooses the blockie. `position` is compared rather than assumed stable: this
 * is the one entity field that changes constantly.
