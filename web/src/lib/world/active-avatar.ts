/**
 * WHICH avatar this client is playing.
 *
 * The template's game is keyed by the account address, so it never has to
 * choose: there is exactly one identity and the chain hands it over. This game
 * commits per AVATAR, and an account can own several, so somebody has to pick
 * one and the pick has to survive a reload.
 *
 * ONE ACTIVE AVATAR PER CLIENT, decided in work:docs/plans/web-port.md. Nothing on
 * chain partitions authority per avatar - `_requireAccountForAvatar` resolves
 * the avatar's OWNER and asks whether the sender may act for that account - so
 * every signer the account has delegated can move every avatar it owns. Keeping
 * one active avatar per client is therefore a CLIENT CONVENTION and not a
 * guarantee; it is what stops two tabs committing over each other, and a player
 * who wants to run two avatars opens a second browser.
 *
 * It is also why the round's storage key includes the avatar id
 * (see ./storage.ts): switching the active avatar with a key that did not would
 * load the previous avatar's planned actions and commit them for the new one.

 * reverts with `AvatarIsDead` - so offering it as the active one would present
 * a playable board that refuses every move.
