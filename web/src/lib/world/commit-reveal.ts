 * Refuse a move the signer demonstrably cannot pay for, BEFORE it is sent.
 *
 * A DOOMED SEND IS NOT FREE. On the local node this game develops against
 * (hardhat 3 / EDR, interval mining), a transaction the node REJECTS for want of
 * gas still advances that account's pending nonce, permanently. The account is
 * then wedged: every later transaction is built at a nonce the chain will never
 * reach, gets a hash, and is never mined.
 *
 * The cost lands squarely on the feature this file is most careful about.
 * `resumeWhenGasArrives` exists so a player who tops up has their round carry on
 * by itself; if the failed send burned a nonce, the retry can never mine, and a
 * turn that was recoverable is lost to a stuck `Committing` instead. Worse here
 * than in the template it came from: a reveal that never lands also blocks the
 * NEXT epoch until `acknowledgeMissedReveal` is called.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NARROW, and an assertion about the app rather than about the
 * chain. It fires only when the balance the player is ALREADY being shown says
 * zero: a store that has loaded, and loaded a nought. So it costs no RPC round
 * trip, it cannot contradict the screen (if it refuses, the HUD is already
 * offering the top-up), and an unloaded or stale store falls through to the
 * behaviour that shipped before it.
 *
 * It does NOT try to answer "can this afford THIS move". That needs a gas
 * estimate on a per-move path and would still be a guess, and a partially funded
 * signer can be rejected and burn a nonce anyway. That is a smaller window and a
 * node defect rather than this app's; paying an estimate on every commit and
 * every reveal to narrow it is not a trade worth making silently.
 *
 * Ported from `placement/commit-reveal.ts`, which is where this file came from.
