/// @notice Acquiring what lets you play, in ONE transaction.
/// @dev A new player needs two unrelated things before their first move: a
///      stake (or this game has no reason for anyone to reveal) and gas in the
///      local key that signs their moves. Asking for those separately is two
///      wallet prompts, and the second one arrives after the first has just
///      spent the wallet down.
///
///      So the call does both. `msg.value` is split: `stipend` goes to the key
///      that will play, and the remainder must equal `PRICE` exactly. The stake
///      itself is credited to `player` by the game, from tokens this contract
///      mints and stakes on their behalf, which is what removes the
///      mint/approve/stake sequence a player used to sign three times.
///
///      THE PAYER IS NOT THE PLAYER, deliberately, and that is inherited from
///      `addToReserve(player, amount)`: whoever sends this pays, and `player` is
///      credited. An account with no wallet of its own (email or social
///      sign-in) can therefore be set up by somebody else's wallet, and topping
///      up a stranger's reserve is a gift rather than an attack, because only
///      its owner can ever withdraw it.
///
///      MINTING FOR FREE IS THIS TEMPLATE'S ANSWER, not the framework's. The
///      token is a faucet so that a fresh deployment is playable immediately; a
///      real game replaces this contract with whatever actually gates entry
///      (selling a token, minting an NFT into custody, checking a pass), and
///      the client rail above it does not change, because all it needs is one
///      call that carries a value and forwards a stipend.
