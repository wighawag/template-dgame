/**
 * An avatar has to COST something, and the mint is what enforces it.
 *
 * This is not a test about a price. `Avatars` is the thing AT STAKE in the
 * commit-reveal round - a missed reveal loses it after the configured number of
 * misses - and the framework's whole foundation is "something must be at stake,
 * or nobody has to reveal" (AGENTS.md). A free mint does not make the game
 * cheap, it makes the commitment meaningless: a player who dislikes what they
 * committed to goes quiet, loses the avatar, and mints another one for gas.
 *
 * `Avatars.mint` used to be `external` with NO ACCESS CONTROL, so all of that
 * was one call away, and `_safeMint` only rejects a tokenID that already
 * exists - so the free avatars were well-formed ones, at the ids the sale would
 * have produced.
 *
 * The tests below therefore assert the INVARIANT ("the sale is the only way to
 * get one") rather than the mechanism, so they keep their meaning if payment
 * later moves to an ERC20: what must stay true is that minting goes through
 * something that charges.
