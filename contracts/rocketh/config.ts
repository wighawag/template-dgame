		 * broadcast, and then be MINED, all inside the window - and the contract
		 * judges the attempt by the timestamp of the block it lands in, not by when
		 * it was sent. Measured against a local node, a reveal fired the instant the
		 * phase opened still landed about 5 seconds later and reverted with
		 * `InCommitmentPhase`, forfeiting the bond.
		 *
		 * A missed reveal costs the player their stake, so this cannot be tuned
		 * optimistically. Size the reveal phase to comfortably exceed one block time
		 * plus a client round trip; ten seconds is generous on a local chain and is
		 * the floor to think from on a real one.
